### Author - Louise Wong

## Introduction

Recreating an Instagram profile page using React to consolidate my skill on React.

### Technology Used:

- React
- JSX
- SCSS

## Description

### App

All the components are inserted in the App.jsx and data is imported in the App.

### Components

Two NavBar components `NavBar` and `GridNavBar` have been created for the top navbar and navbar before the posts.
Mapping was used in the `Posts` and `Highlight` components to map out the posts or highlights of the profile.
The profile information is consists of `HeaderDetail`, `Bio` and ` ProfilePicture` components where it includes the follow button and all the profile details. The `ProfilePicture` component is used again in `NavBar` showing the default user picture.
Finally, the `ProfileDetail` component displays the profile's statistics such as the number of followers and posts.

## Roadmap

### Features to add

- add functionality to the grid navbar
- add functionality to the follow button
- add routing to a different user profile
